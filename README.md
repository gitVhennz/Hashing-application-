Student Attendance System Documentation

Introduction :
The Student Attendance System is a Java console application designed to help manage student attendance records efficiently. It uses a custom hash table implementation to store and retrieve student attendance data. This program simulates a real-world system where each student is uniquely identified by their ID, and their attendance is updated or queried as needed.

Features: 
Add students with unique IDs. 
Mark and update attendance. 
Check individual attendance. 
Display all attendance records
Exit: Close the system gracefully

Why I made this program : 
To demonstrate hash table usage in solving real-world problems, improve programming skills, and showcase efficient data handling techniques.
